# Literature Review Workflow: Wikipedia Bot Activity and Automation Bias

## Overview
This workflow automates the literature review process for research on Wikipedia bot activity, automation bias, and AI-generated content. It extracts key information from academic papers to support research on how automated agents influence knowledge representation on Wikipedia.

## Input
- PDF files of academic papers related to:
  - Wikipedia bot activity and behavior
  - Automation bias in content creation
  - AI-generated content detection and analysis
  - Human-bot collaboration in knowledge platforms
  - Citation patterns and content quality in automated systems

## Output
- Structured analysis of each paper including:
  - Research questions and methodology
  - Key findings related to bot behavior and bias
  - Data sources and analysis methods
  - Relevance to Wikipedia automation research
  - Citation patterns and reference quality

## Instructions

### 1. Paper Analysis
For each paper, extract:

**Basic Information:**
- Title, authors, publication venue, year
- Research questions or hypotheses
- Methodology and data sources
- Key findings and conclusions

**Wikipedia/Bot Specific Analysis:**
- Bot detection methods used
- Human vs bot edit patterns identified
- Citation behavior differences
- Content quality metrics
- Bias indicators or concerns raised

**Relevance Assessment:**
- How does this paper relate to automation bias research?
- What insights apply to Wikipedia content creation?
- What methods could be adapted for our research?

### 2. Cross-Paper Synthesis
- Identify common themes across papers
- Note conflicting findings or methodologies
- Highlight gaps in current research
- Suggest areas for further investigation

### 3. Research Integration
- How do findings support or challenge our research questions?
- What methodologies should we adopt or avoid?
- What additional papers should we seek?

## Constraints
- Focus on papers from 2015-2024 (recent developments in AI/bot research)
- Prioritize peer-reviewed academic sources
- Include both quantitative and qualitative studies
- Consider papers from multiple disciplines (computer science, information science, social science)
